## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS including Flexbox using the OOCSS methodology
- Sass

### What I learned

In completing this project, I reinforced several techniques and ideas that I had learned for previous projects, namely Flexbox, 
OOCSS, and placeholder classes in Sass.

### Continued development

- While I have used Flexbox on most of the Frontend Mentor projects that I have completed so far, I have yet to use CSS Grid. 
Looking at some of the remaining Newbie projects, it looks like I'll need to learn CSS Grid sooner rather than ater.

- I still have troube reproducing a box-shadow from a design. Mine always come out too dark.
